# housePredicting
This project predicts house prices using gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. Gradient descent updates weights over 2000 iterations using the entire dataset. Stochastic gradient descent performs 20,000 iterations with random samples. The predict function estimates prices based on trained weights, bedrooms, and area.
